              As the recipient, you have a legal obligation to take reasonable

            receipt or proof of purchase, to the following address:
            <br />

          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">Shipping charges:</h2>
          <p>
            The shipping charges associated with returning a product are
            non-refundable. You are responsible for covering the shipping costs
            and assuming the risk of loss or damage during transit, both when
            returning the item and when it is in our possession. Additionally,
            if your original order qualified for free shipping and the refund
            brings the total order value below the threshold for free shipping,
            shipping charges will be deducted from the refund amount.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">Damaged items:</h2>
          <p>
            If you have received a damaged product, please contact us
            immediately for assistance. Cricket bats are manufactured using
            willow, and their durability is subject to proper usage. It is
            essential for customers to handle the bats correctly to avoid
            breakage. Consequently, if a customer fails to use the bat
            appropriately and it breaks due to improper usage, they will be held
            accountable for the damage incurred.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">Bowling Machines:</h2>
          <p>
            Returned bowling machines that have been opened or turned on within
            the 7-day return period will incur a minimum restocking fee of 25%.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">Sale items:</h2>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, we cannot offer refunds for sale items. Only
            regular-priced items are eligible for refunds.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">PayPal Transactions:</h2>
          <p>
            If you cancel your order for any reason and have paid via PayPal, a
            3.5% deduction will apply due to PayPalâ€™s policy of not refunding
            merchant fees after the transaction is processed.
